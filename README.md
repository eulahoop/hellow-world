Just to get the feel of the new ways to create and develop projects.
Coding is a lot easier with Git Hub Repositiories.
Rather than re-invent the wheel lets leverage the exisiting coding technolgies.
Hopefully this will save me time in the medium to long term.
Having worked in the industry in its infancy (the 80's) I hope some of those disciplines can be transferred onto the newer platforms.
Recently a prototype android project was my proving ground for the concept of upskilling to the new toolsets.
This proved successful and now wishing to leverage open-source code to develop more feature advanced applications.
